# Gramex open source manifesto

Gramener is committed to making and retaining Gramex as open source.

## Who is Gramener? What is Gramex?

[Gramener](https://gramener.com/) is a data science company. We narrate insights
from data as stories. This journey involves connecting to data sources,
transforming the data, analyzing using statistical and machine learning models,
visualizing the insights, allowing users to explore them, and deploying it for
production.

We built [Gramex](https://github.com/gramener/gramex) as a platform to automate
these steps. It's a code-free platform for developers to design and deploy data
applications.

## Why open source?

Every analysis should be useful and non-obvious. They should be narrated
memorably. Everyone deserves to enjoy these insights from data as stories.

To scale this world-wide, we need two things: technology and ease of access.
Gramex brings in the technology and automates this process. Open source brings
in the ease of access.

So we **commit** to releasing a Community Edition of Gramex, to keep it open source, and to continuously improve it.

To sustain this, we'll sell an Enterprise Edition. It will host the newer
enterprise features that we constantly add. (By enterprise features, we mean
administration, data management, security and workflow). But these too will be
in the Community Edition after six months of release.

This isn't altruism. We believe insights as stories unlock tremendous value. As
usage spreads, the small fraction that needs and buys the Enterprise Edition
will more than sustain Gramex.
