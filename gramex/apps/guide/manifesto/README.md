# Gramex open source manifesto

Gramener is committed to making and retaining Gramex as open source.

## Who is Gramener? What is Gramex?

[Gramener](https://gramener.com/) is a data science company. We narrate insights
from data as stories. We built the [Gramex](https://github.com/gramener/gramex)
platform to automate these.

## Why open source?

Every analysis should be useful and non-obvious. They should be narrated
memorably. Everyone deserves to enjoy these insights from data as stories.

To scale this world-wide, we need technology and ease of access. Gramex
automates the process. Open source brings ease of access. We're **committed** to
enhancing Gramex and keeping it open source.

To sustain this, we'll sell an enterprise version with the newer enterprise
features that we constantly add. (By enterprise features, we mean
administration, data management, security and workflow). But these too will be
open source after six months of release.

This isn't altruism. We believe insights as stories unlock tremendous value. As
usage spreads, the small fraction that needs and buys the enterprise version
will more than sustain Gramex.
